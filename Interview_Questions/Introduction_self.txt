Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
It’s my pleasure to introduce myself.
My name is Sumantra Upadhyay. I completed my graduation from UPTU.
I began my career as a IT Support and later moved into DevOps Engineering. Currently, I’m working as a DevOps Engineer at Reliance.
I have total 9Y of experience in which 4Y is in DevOps.

In my current project, where I manage Azure infrastructure using Terraform, provisioning resources like VNets, Subnets, and Virtual Machines. 
I also configure and maintain CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps for smooth deployments and troubleshoot Terraform-related issues, 
and have hands-on experience with Docker, Git, and CI/CD best practices. 
If allowed, I’d be happy to explain my current project and day-to-day responsibilities.
In my recent project titled “Zayo E-Commerce Cloud Migration,” I worked on migrating a monolithic e-commerce platform to a microservices architecture. 
Our team had 20 members — 5 in DevOps and 15 in development. The frontend was built in React.js, the backend in Python, and we used Azure SQL for data storage.
I am responsible for provisioning the entire cloud infrastructure using Terraform, which included AKS clusters, networking components, storage accounts, databases, 
virtual machines, and Key Vaults.
Our architecture was aligned with Azure’s best practices using the landing zone approach. We segregated the environment into Dev, QA, and Prod, 
each with its own subscription under a management group. To ensure code reusability and modularization, we followed a parent-child module structure 
in Terraform — separating environment-level and module-level code into dedicated folders.
For secure and scalable access, we used Application Gateway with a Web Application Firewall (WAF), custom domains, and SSL certificates. 
The entire infrastructure is managed via Terraform modules, with well-structured repositories for each environment.
We containerized all the services using Docker and stored the images in Azure Container Registry (ACR). I also built CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps, 
which handled automated testing, Docker builds, security scans, and deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 
We followed CI/CD best practices such as Git-based version control, pull request reviews, and secret management through Azure Key Vault.
For observability, we integrated Prometheus, Grafana, and Azure Monitor, and configured alerts for failures and performance issues
